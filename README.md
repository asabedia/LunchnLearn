# Before you start
1. Make sure you have python version 3.0 or higher
2. Make sure you have pip version 19 or higher
3. Install Docker
# How to set up environment
clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/asabedia/LunchnLearn.git
```
open up your terminal, cd into the project, and run the launch_server shell script, this will spin up the postgresql database on a docker container and will migrate the database schemas and the fixture data to the postgres database. The script will then create a python virtual environment called 'lnlvenv' and install the required dependencies. Finally this command will also run the Django server on localhost:8000. If you do not have Docker installed, please install it first before running the command below. I have provided a link to follow to install Docker below.
https://docs.docker.com/install/
```
bash launch_server.sh
```
After you run the command above, you should see in your terminal that the server is ready to accept requests. 

This will load fake data into the Postgres database

Finally, you can boot up the application by running:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
It is suggested that you use Google Chrome to view this application
Go on to localhost:8000 to view the lunch and learn application
